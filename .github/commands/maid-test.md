description: Run MAID methodology test as isolated sub-agent with ultrathink quality verification
---

# /maid-test

Launch an isolated sub-agent to test MAID methodology (Phases 0-3) with **ultrathink** quality verification at each step.

## Usage

```
/maid-test              # Full test (Phases 0-3) with ultrathink
/maid-test --phase 0    # Test only Phase 0
/maid-test --phase 3    # Test only Phase 3 (including sub-phases 3a, 3b, 3c)
/maid-test --quick      # 1 output per phase (still uses ultrathink)
/maid-test --verbose    # Show all reflection + thinking details
```

## What This Does

Launches a **sub-agent** that runs independently to:
1. Simulate realistic outputs for each phase
2. **Use ultrathink** on every simulated user message for deep quality verification
3. Run quality checks with reflection
4. Test deliberate failures (verify bad content is caught)
5. Validate phase gate transitions
6. **Test Phase 3 sub-phases** (consolidation, breakdown, JSON export)
7. Generate comprehensive test report with thinking analysis

## Ultrathink Integration

**CRITICAL**: Every simulated user message in the test MUST include `ultrathink` to trigger extended thinking for quality verification.

### Why Ultrathink?

| Without Ultrathink | With Ultrathink |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Quick surface-level check | Deep reasoning about correctness |
| May miss edge cases | Catches subtle issues |
| Basic validation | Comprehensive quality analysis |
| Standard output | Verified, high-confidence output |

### Ultrathink Message Format

Each simulated user message follows this pattern:

```
[SIMULATED USER - STEP N]
ultrathink

{actual user request}

VERIFY:
- [ ] Output matches phase requirements
- [ ] WHY alignment maintained
- [ ] No phase gate violations
- [ ] Quality score >= 7
```

## Execution

When this command is invoked, use the Task tool to launch a sub-agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: "You are the MAID Test Agent with ULTRATHINK verification.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For EVERY simulated user message, you MUST:
1. Include 'ultrathink' keyword to trigger extended thinking
2. Use deep reasoning to verify quality before producing output
3. Log thinking insights in the test report

Read and follow .github/agents/maid-test-agent/AGENT-PROMPT.md exactly.

Run the complete test sequence for Phases 0-3.
For Phase 3, test all sub-phases (3a: Consolidation, 3b: Task Breakdown, 3c: JSON Export).

ULTRATHINK VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (apply to each step):
□ Is the output correct for this phase?
□ Does it follow WHY-driven principles?
□ Are there any edge cases missed?
□ Would this pass a thorough code review?
□ Is the quality score >= 7?

Generate all outputs to .maid/test-outputs/test-{timestamp}/.
Include thinking-log.md with ultrathink insights.
Return a summary when complete.",

)
```

## Isolation

The sub-agent:
- Does NOT modify project state (.maid/state.json)
- Does NOT create docs/ files
- Does NOT interact with external services (no Jira MCP)
- Only writes to .maid/test-outputs/
- Uses JSON export instead of Jira for Phase 3c

## Expected Output

Sub-agent returns summary:

```

| Gates | Required files exist, proper transitions | Transition logic verification |
| Phases | No jumping ahead, appropriate content | Content quality deep-dive |
| Phase 3a | Contradictions detected, resolution hierarchy | Resolution reasoning |
| Phase 3b | Task structure, estimates < 4 hrs, dependencies | Dependency logic check |
