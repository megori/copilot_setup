2. MCP server enabled in Figma inspect panel
3. Component selected in Figma

## Process

I will:
1. Connect to Figma MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

3. Load the `figma-design-review` skill from `.github/skills/`
4. Audit the component against SKILL.md validation rules
5. Generate improvement suggestions
6. Produce a quality report

When this command is invoked, use the Figma MCP tools to:

1. First, call `mcp__figma__get_figma_data` with the file key to get component information
