# /test-phase-review

Test the phase-review-agent to verify it:
1. Correctly validates phase deliverables against checklist
2. Returns PASS only when ALL required items present
3. Returns FAIL for missing critical items
4. Provides specific location references

## Usage

```
/test-phase-review            # Full test with all phases
/test-phase-review --phase 1  # Test only Phase 1 validation
/test-phase-review --quick    # 2 scenarios only
/test-phase-review --verbose  # Show full agent responses
```

## What This Tests

### Phase Checklists

## Test Execution

When invoked, spawn a test agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: "You are testing the phase-review-agent for accuracy.
