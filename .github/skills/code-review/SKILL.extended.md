## Security Checklist (CRITICAL)

### OWASP Top 10 Scan

| Vulnerability | What to Check | Red Flag |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Injection** (SQL/NoSQL/Command) | User input in queries | String concatenation in queries |
| **Broken Auth** | Session handling, password storage | Plain text passwords, weak tokens |
| **Sensitive Data Exposure** | Logging, error messages | Secrets in logs, stack traces to users |
| **XXE** | XML parsing | External entity processing enabled |
| **Broken Access Control** | Authorization checks | Missing role/permission validation |
| **Security Misconfiguration** | Headers, CORS, defaults | Debug mode in prod, open CORS |
| **XSS** | Output encoding | `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| **Insecure Deserialization** | Object parsing | `eval()`, `pickle.loads()` on user data |
| **Vulnerable Components** | Dependencies | Outdated packages with CVEs |
| **Insufficient Logging** | Audit trails | No logging of auth events |

### Security Code Patterns

```typescript
// ❌ CRITICAL: SQL Injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ✅ SAFE: Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);

// ❌ CRITICAL: XSS vulnerability
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// ✅ SAFE: Text content or sanitization
element.textContent = userInput;

// ❌ CRITICAL: Command injection
exec(`ls ${userPath}`);

// ✅ SAFE: Avoid shell, use APIs
fs.readdir(userPath);

// ❌ CRITICAL: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk-1234567890';

// ✅ SAFE: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### Security Review Questions

- [ ] Is ALL user input validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- [ ] Are secrets stored in environment variables?
- [ ] Is authentication checked on every protected route?
- [ ] Is authorization (roles/permissions) enforced?
- [ ] Are error messages safe (no stack traces to users)?
- [ ] Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- [ ] Are dependencies up to date (no known CVEs)?

## TDD Checklist (PRIORITY)

### TDD Process Validation

| Question | Expected | Red Flag |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Were tests written first? | Yes, commit history shows tests before impl | Implementation committed without tests |
| Do tests define behavior? | Tests describe WHAT, not HOW | Tests check internal implementation details |
| Do tests fail first? | Red → Green → Refactor cycle | Tests that never failed |
| Is coverage adequate? | Critical paths covered | Only happy path tested |
| Are tests independent? | Each test runs in isolation | Tests depend on execution order |

### Test Quality Standards

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Testing implementation details
test('calls internal method', () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(service, '_privateMethod');
  service.doThing();
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();  // Testing HOW, not WHAT
});

// ✅ GOOD: Testing behavior/outcome
test('returns processed result', () => {
  const result = service.doThing();
  expect(result).toEqual(expectedOutput);  // Testing WHAT
});

// ❌ BAD: Unrealistic mock data
const mockUser = { id: 1, name: 'test' };

// ✅ GOOD: Realistic test data
const mockUser = {
  id: 'usr_abc123',
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  email: 'jane@example.com',
  createdAt: new Date('2024-01-15'),
  roles: ['user', 'admin']
};

// ❌ BAD: Only happy path
test('creates user', () => {
  const user = createUser(validData);
  expect(user).toBeDefined();
});

// ✅ GOOD: Edge cases covered
test('creates user with valid data', () => { /* ... */ });
test('throws on missing email', () => { /* ... */ });
test('throws on duplicate username', () => { /* ... */ });
test('handles unicode names', () => { /* ... */ });
```

### TDD Review Questions

- [ ] Do tests exist for ALL new/changed functionality?
- [ ] Are tests testing behavior, not implementation?
- [ ] Is test data realistic (not just `{ id: 1 }`)?
- [ ] Are edge cases covered (nulls, empty, boundaries)?
- [ ] Are error scenarios tested?
- [ ] Do tests run independently (no shared state)?
- [ ] Were tests NOT modified just to make them pass?

## ISO 27001 Compliance Checklist

Quick checks aligned with ISO 27001 security controls:

| Control | Check | Review Question |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **A.8.1** Asset Management | Dependencies | Are all dependencies documented and licensed? |
| **A.8.2** Classification | Data Sensitivity | Is sensitive data (PII, credentials) identified and protected? |
| **A.9.2** Authentication | Auth Security | Is authentication secure (strong passwords, MFA, secure sessions)? |
| **A.9.4** Access Control | Authorization | Are permissions checked on all protected resources? |
| **A.12.2** Change Management | PR Process | Does change follow branching/review standards? |
| **A.12.4** Env Separation | Environments | Is prod data never used in dev? Configs separated? |
| **A.12.6** Logging | Audit Trail | Are security events logged (auth, access, changes)? |
| **A.14.2** Secure Dev | Security Tests | Are security tests included? Pre-commit hooks active? |
| **A.18.1** Compliance | Regulatory | Does code meet GDPR/PCI/HIPAA requirements if applicable? |

### Project Organization (ISO 27001 Aligned)

```
Required Files:
✓ SECURITY.md          - Security policy, vulnerability reporting
✓ .github/CODEOWNERS   - Code ownership for access control
✓ .gitignore           - Exclude secrets, logs, sensitive files
✓ .env.example         - Template only (no real values)
✓ docs/security/       - Security documentation

Must NOT be in repo:
✗ .env with credentials
✗ Private keys (*.pem, *.key)
✗ Database dumps
✗ Log files with sensitive data
```

## Code Quality Checklists

### 1. No Shortcuts or Workarounds

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| `catch (e) { }` | Silent exception swallowing |
| `// TODO`, `// FIXME`, `// HACK` | Incomplete work |
| Commented-out code | Dead code, unclear intent |
| `if (false) { }` or disabled logic | Tests/features disabled to pass |
| `any` type overuse | Type safety bypassed |

### 2. No Hardcoded Values

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| `if (status === 3)` | `if (status === Status.APPROVED)` |
| `setTimeout(fn, 5000)` | `setTimeout(fn, TIMEOUT_MS)` |
| `'http://localhost:3000'` | `process.env.API_URL` |
| `width: '768px'` | `width: var(--breakpoint-md)` |

### 3. Root Cause Fixes

| Symptom Fix (Bad) | Root Cause Fix (Good) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Add null check where crash occurs | Validate data at entry point |
| Retry failed request 3 times | Fix why request fails |
| Catch and ignore error | Handle error appropriately |
| Add delay to avoid race condition | Fix the race condition |

### 4. Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] DRY: No copy-pasted logic
- [ ] Type hints on public functions
- [ ] Meaningful variable/function names
- [ ] No overly broad exception handling
- [ ] Error messages MAID debugging

### 5. MANDATORY Documentation Standards

**EVERY file MUST have documentation at THREE levels:**

| Level | Required | Red Flag |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **File** | @file, @description, @related, @created | No file header comment |
| **Component/Class** | Purpose, responsibilities | Class without doc comment |
| **Function** | @param, @returns, @throws, @related | Undocumented functions |

```typescript
// ❌ MISSING: No documentation
export function createUser(data) {
  return db.create(data);
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Full documentation
/**
 * Creates a new user account with validation.
 *
 * @param data - User creation input
 * @returns Created user object
 * @throws {ValidationError} If email invalid
 *
 * @related
 *   - ./UserRepository.ts - Database persistence
 *   - ../validators/email.ts - Email validation
 */
export async function createUser(data: CreateUserInput): Promise<User> {
```

### Documentation Review Questions

- [ ] Does file have @file, @description, @related, @created header?
- [ ] Does every class/component have a purpose comment?
- [ ] Does every function have @param, @returns, @throws?
- [ ] Are cross-file dependencies documented with @related?
- [ ] Do inline comments explain non-obvious logic?

### 6. Architecture & Patterns

- [ ] Follows existing project patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Thread-safe where required
- [ ] No business logic in controllers/routes

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Security Scan First
```bash
# Check for secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|api_key\|token" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Check for SQL injection patterns
grep -r "SELECT.*\${" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Check for XSS patterns
grep -r "innerHTML\|dangerouslySetInnerHTML" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx"
```

### Step 2: TDD Validation
```bash
# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Verify tests exist for changed files
# For each src/foo.ts, check if src/foo.test.ts exists
```

### Step 3: Code Quality
- Read each changed file
- Apply checklists
- Document issues with `file:line` references

### Step 4: Verdict
| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Any critical security issue | ✗ Needs Rework |
| No tests for new functionality | ⚠️ Needs Review |
| Minor issues only | ✓ Ready (with suggestions) |
| No issues found | ✓ Ready to merge |

## Learning Mode Integration

### Decision Transparency Triggers
- **Verdict decisions**: Explain why specific verdict given
- **Issue severity**: Show reasoning for critical vs major vs minor
- **Exception handling**: Document when issues are acceptable

### Debate Invitations
- **Architectural concerns**: When patterns deviate from standards
- **Security trade-offs**: When perfect security conflicts with usability
- **Technical debt acceptance**: When shortcuts are being considered

### Feedback Requests
- After review complete: Validate findings are clear
- After significant findings: Confirm severity assessment
- Request feedback on review thoroughness

### Example Transparency Block for Code Review
```markdown
<decision-transparency>
**Decision:** Approve with minor suggestions (Ready ✓)

**Reasoning:**
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities found
- **Testing**: All new code has tests
- **Quality**: Minor naming suggestions only

**Issues Found:**
1. Minor: Variable name `d` could be `data` (line 42)
2. Minor: Consider extracting magic number 5 to constant

**Confidence:** High - Standard approval scenario

**Open to Debate:** No - Clear pass with minor improvements
</decision-transparency>
```

### Example Debate Invitation for Code Review
```markdown
<debate-invitation>
**Topic:** Handling of deprecated API usage

**Option A: Block Until Fixed**
- ✅ Pros: No technical debt
- ❌ Cons: Delays release

**Option B: Approve with Follow-up Task**
- ✅ Pros: Pragmatic, allows progress
- ❌ Cons: Debt may linger

**My Lean:** Option B - Create ticket, set deadline

**Your Input Needed:** Is there a release deadline? How critical is this code path?
</debate-invitation>
```

### Learning Capture Example
```markdown
<learning-captured>
**What I Learned:**
This team prefers blocking on any security warnings, even low severity.

**Source:**
- User feedback on: Code review verdict
- Context: Asked to escalate low-severity CORS warning

**Applied To:**
- Future reviews will flag all security warnings as requiring attention
- Will not auto-approve with security findings

**Verification:**
- Next review with security findings will flag for review
</learning-captured>
