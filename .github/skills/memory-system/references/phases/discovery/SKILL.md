## Quick Reference

**Phase**: 0 - Discovery
**Purpose**: Validate problem space and gather research insights before PRD
**Output**: `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[project-name]/`

## Key Activities

### Activity A: UNDERSTAND
- Problem Analysis (5 Whys, Problem Severity Assessment)
- Stakeholder Research (Interviews, Power/Interest Matrix)
- Market & Competitive Research (JTBD, Competitive Analysis)

### Activity B: EXPLORE
- Divergent Thinking (SCAMPER, Crazy 8s, Six Hats)
- Root Cause Investigation (Systems Thinking, TRIZ, TOC)
- Opportunity Synthesis (Insight Clustering)

### Activity C: DEFINE
- Strategic Positioning (Blue Ocean Canvas, Value Proposition)
- Solution Evaluation (Opportunity Scoring, Assumption Mapping)
- Research Synthesis (Final Report)

## Exit Criteria (Gate to Phase 1)

- [ ] Problem validated with multiple stakeholders
- [ ] Root causes identified and verified
- [ ] Market/competitive landscape understood
- [ ] Solution space explored (not just one idea)
- [ ] Strategic positioning defined
- [ ] All assumptions made explicit and tested
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision justified with evidence
- [ ] Traceability matrix complete with IDs (RES-XXX)

## Traceability ID Format

```
[Project]-[Activity]-[Type]-[Number]

Examples:
- PROJ-A-INT-001  = Interview finding #1
- PROJ-B-IDEA-003 = Idea #3
- PROJ-C-OPP-002  = Opportunity #2
```
