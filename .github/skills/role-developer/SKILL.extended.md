# Developer Role

## Core Responsibilities

- Translate requirements into technical designs
- Write clean, tested, maintainable code
- Debug systematically - never guess
- Identify technical risks and edge cases early
- Ensure code quality through testing and review

## Phase-Specific Focus

| Phase | Focus | Key Outputs |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Discovery | Technical feasibility | Risk notes, complexity estimates |
| PRD | Requirements clarity | Technical questions, edge cases |
| Tech Spec | Architecture design | Tech spec, API contracts, data models |
| Development | Implementation | Production code, tests, docs |
| QA & Ship | Bug fixes, release | Fixes, deployment docs |

## TDD Workflow

Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

```
1. RED      → Write failing test
2. GREEN   → Write minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR → Clean up (tests still pass)
4. REPEAT
```

## Systematic Debugging

**Iron Law: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION.**

### Four Phases

1. **Root Cause** - Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find working examples, compare, identify differences
3. **Hypothesis** - Form single theory, test minimally, one variable at a time
4. **Implementation** - Create failing test, single fix, verify

If 3+ fixes failed → Stop and question architecture.

See `references/debugging-checklist.md` for complete checklist.
See `references/root-cause-tracing.md` for tracing technique.

## Defense-in-Depth

Validate at EVERY layer data passes through:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Entry Point | Reject invalid input at API boundary |
| Business Logic | Validate for specific operation |
| Environment Guards | Block dangerous ops in test/CI |
| Debug Instrumentation | Log context for forensics |

See `references/defense-in-depth.ts` for implementation example.

## Development Constraints

### 300-Line Rule

| File Size | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| < 200 lines | ✅ Ideal |
| 200-300 lines | ⚠️ Consider splitting |
| 300-400 lines | 🔴 Split now |
| > 400 lines | ❌ Must refactor |

Split when: multiple responsibilities, approaching limit, hard to name, multiple test files needed.

### Module Structure

```
feature/
├── feature.controller.ts   # HTTP layer (thin)
├── feature.service.ts      # Business logic
├── feature.repository.ts   # Data access
├── feature.types.ts        # Types/interfaces
└── feature.validation.ts   # Input validation
```

## Async Testing

Never use arbitrary timeouts. Wait for conditions:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
await sleep(100);
expect(result).toBeDefined();

// ✅ Right
await waitFor(() => result !== undefined);
expect(result).toBeDefined();
```

See `references/condition-based-waiting.ts` for utilities.

## Code Quality Standards

### Must Have
- Single responsibility functions
- DRY code
- Type hints on public functions
- Meaningful names
- Proper error handling
- Files under 300 lines
- Multi-layer validation

### Must Not Have
- `any` types without justification
- TODO/FIXME comments (track separately)
- Commented-out code
- Silent exception swallowing
- Business logic in controllers
- Arbitrary timeouts in tests
- Files over 400 lines

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| No TDD | Write tests first |
| `if is_test:` in prod | No test logic in prod code |
| Happy path only | Test errors and edge cases |
| Over-mocking (>20%) | Use real dependencies |
| Guessing at fixes | Systematic debugging |
| Large files (>400) | Split into modules |

## Handoff Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] No files exceed 400 lines
- [ ] Multi-layer validation added

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/find-polluter.sh` | Find which test creates pollution |
| `scripts/check-file-size.sh` | Enforce 300-line rule |

| File | When to Read |

| `references/root-cause-tracing.md` | Bug deep in call stack |
| `references/defense-in-depth.ts` | After fixing data validation bugs |
