# Tech Spec Phase Skill

## Phase Overview

**Purpose**: Design the technical solution that will implement the requirements. Create a blueprint that developers can follow without ambiguity.

**Entry Criteria**:
- PRD phase completed and approved
- Requirements are clear and testable
- Dependencies identified
- Non-functional requirements defined

**Exit Criteria**:
- Tech spec document complete and approved
- Architecture decisions documented
- API contracts defined
- Data models specified
- Implementation can begin

## Deliverables

### 1. Tech Spec Document
- **Description**: Technical design for implementing requirements
- **Format**: Structured document with architecture, APIs, data models
- **Quality bar**: Developer can implement without needing clarification

### 2. Architecture Diagram
- **Description**: Visual representation of system components
- **Format**: Component diagram, sequence diagrams as needed
- **Quality bar**: Shows all major components and their interactions

### 3. API Contracts
- **Description**: Interface definitions for all endpoints/services
- **Format**: OpenAPI/Swagger, or structured documentation
- **Quality bar**: Request/response schemas, error codes, examples

### 4. Data Models
- **Description**: Database schemas, data structures
- **Format**: ERD, schema definitions, type definitions
- **Quality bar**: All fields defined with types and constraints

## Role-Specific Guidance

### For Product Managers
- Validate technical approach addresses requirements
- Clarify requirements when questions arise
- Ensure user experience isn't compromised
- Review for scope alignment

### For Developers
- Own the tech spec document
- Design for maintainability and testability
- Consider error handling from the start
- Document trade-offs and decisions

### For QA Engineers
- Review for testability
- Identify integration test points
- Plan test environment needs
- Flag potential test data challenges

### For Tech Leads
- Review architecture decisions
- Ensure alignment with standards
- Validate scalability approach
- Approve technical direction

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Over-engineering | Building for hypothetical futures | Design for current needs |
| Missing error handling | Errors undefined until coding | Define error scenarios upfront |
| Tight coupling | Hard to test and modify | Design for testability and modularity |
| Ignoring non-functionals | Performance issues later | Address performance, security, scalability |
| Unclear contracts | API ambiguity | APIs must be unambiguous with examples |

## Learning Mode Integration

### Decision Transparency Triggers
- **Architecture decisions**: ALWAYS show reasoning for architecture choices
- **Technology selections**: Explain why specific tech stack chosen
- **Trade-off decisions**: Document what was sacrificed and why
- **Pattern selection**: Show why specific patterns chosen over alternatives

### Debate Invitations
- **Database selection**: When multiple viable options exist
- **Architecture pattern**: Monolith vs microservices, etc.
- **API design**: REST vs GraphQL, sync vs async
- **Caching strategy**: When trade-offs are significant

### Feedback Requests
- After architecture diagram: Validate approach
- After API contracts: Confirm completeness
- At phase gate: Overall Tech Spec quality rating (1-5)

### Example Transparency Block
```markdown
<decision-transparency>
**Decision:** Using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

**Reasoning:**
- **Data relationships**: Complex user-org-project hierarchy = relational model
- **ACID compliance**: Financial data requires transactions
- **Team familiarity**: Team has PostgreSQL experience

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. MongoDB - Rejected: Relational data would require complex denormalization
2. MySQL - Viable but PostgreSQL has better JSON support

**Confidence:** High - Clear fit for requirements

**Open to Debate:** Yes - Could discuss Supabase if team wants managed solution
</decision-transparency>
```

### Example Debate Invitation
```markdown
<debate-invitation>
**Topic:** Architecture approach for small team

**Option A: Microservices**
- ✅ Pros: Independent scaling, tech flexibility
- ❌ Cons: Operational overhead, distributed debugging

**Option B: Modular Monolith**
- ✅ Pros: Simple ops, easy debugging, lower cost
- ❌ Cons: All-or-nothing deployments

**My Lean:** Option B - Team of 3 doesn't have capacity for microservices ops

**But Consider:** If specific service needs independent scaling, hybrid approach

**Your Input Needed:** What's the team size? Any services with unique scaling needs?
