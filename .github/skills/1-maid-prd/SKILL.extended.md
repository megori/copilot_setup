# PRD Phase Skill

## Phase Overview

**Purpose**: Define what will be built with enough clarity that development can proceed without ambiguity. Translate validated problems into actionable requirements.

**Entry Criteria**:
- Discovery phase completed and approved
- Problem statement validated
- Stakeholders identified
- Success metrics defined
- **Traceability matrix from Pre-PRD Research available**
- **All research findings have assigned IDs**

**Exit Criteria**:
- PRD document complete and approved
- All user stories have acceptance criteria
- Scope is explicitly defined (in and out)
- Dependencies identified
- **Every requirement linked to research finding(s) OR flagged as assumption**
- **Traceability matrix updated with PRD links**

## Deliverables

### 1. PRD Document
- **Description**: Comprehensive requirements document
- **Format**: Structured document with sections for context, requirements, scope
- **Quality bar**: Readable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders

### 2. User Stories
- **Description**: Requirements from user perspective
- **Format**: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- **Quality bar**: Each story is independent, testable, and valuable

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
- **Description**: Specific conditions for each requirement
- **Format**: Given-When-Then or checklist format
- **Quality bar**: Unambiguous, testable, complete

### 4. Scope Definition
- **Description**: What's included and explicitly excluded
- **Format**: In-scope / Out-of-scope lists
- **Quality bar**: No ambiguous boundaries

### 5. Requirements Traceability
- **Description**: Linkage between research findings and PRD requirements
- **Format**: Updated traceability matrix with bidirectional links
- **Quality bar**: Every requirement has research backing OR explicit assumption flag

## Role-Specific Guidance

### For Product Managers
- Own the PRD document
- Write user stories from user perspective
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Guard against scope creep
- **Maintain traceability links to research**
- **Document and track assumptions**
- **Ensure no research findings are "lost"**

### For Developers
- Review for technical feasibility
- Identify missing edge cases
- Flag unclear requirements
- Estimate complexity per story
- **Verify requirements make sense given research context**

### For QA Engineers
- Review acceptance criteria for testability
- Identify test scenarios
- Flag missing error cases
- Plan test data needs
- **Use research findings to inform test scenarios**

### For Tech Leads
- Validate architectural fit
- Identify cross-cutting concerns
- Flag non-functional requirements
- Review for consistency with standards
- **Challenge assumptions without research backing**

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Implementation in requirements | Mixing "what" with "how" | Keep requirements focused on outcomes |
| Untestable criteria | "Should be fast" | "Should load in <2 seconds" |
| Missing error cases | Only happy path defined | Define what happens when things go wrong |
| Scope creep | New requirements sneak in | Explicit acknowledgment for any additions |
| Hidden assumptions | Unstated expectations | Make all assumptions explicit |
| **Orphan requirements** | Requirements without research backing | Link to research ID or flag as assumption |
| **Lost research** | Research findings not becoming requirements | Review traceability matrix for unused findings |
| **Broken trace links** | IDs don't match between docs | Validate IDs exist in research report |

## Learning Mode Integration

### Decision Transparency Triggers
- **Scope decisions**: Show reasoning when features are in/out of scope
- **Prioritization**: Explain why certain stories are higher priority
- **Acceptance criteria choices**: Show why specific criteria were selected
- **Traceability decisions**: Explain research-to-requirement mappings

### Debate Invitations
- **Feature scope**: When feature boundaries are ambiguous
- **Story granularity**: When stories could be combined or split
- **Acceptance criteria stringency**: When criteria could be more/less strict
- **Assumption risk**: When assumptions have unclear impact

### Feedback Requests
- After user stories draft: Validate completeness and format
- After acceptance criteria: Confirm testability
- After traceability mapping: Verify research coverage
- At phase gate: Overall PRD quality rating (1-5)

### Example Feedback Request
```markdown
<feedback-request>
**Context:** PRD draft completed for User Authentication feature

**Seeking Feedback On:**
1. Completeness of user stories - did I capture all scenarios?
2. Clarity of acceptance criteria - are they testable?
3. Scope boundaries - is OAuth correctly deferred?
4. Traceability - are research findings properly linked?

**Questions:**
- Should "Remember me" be Phase 1 or Phase 2?
- Are there compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR) I should address?
- Any research findings I missed linking?

**Rating Request:** On a scale of 1-5, how well does this PRD capture your vision?

**Improvement Ideas Welcome:** What would make this PRD better?
</feedback-request>
```

### Example Debate Invitation
```markdown
<debate-invitation>
**Topic:** Password requirements stringency

**Option A: Standard Requirements**
- Pros: Familiar to users, lower friction
- Cons: May not meet enterprise security needs
- Research Support: [PROJECT]-A-INT-003 (users prefer simplicity)

**Option B: Enterprise-Grade Requirements**
- Pros: Higher security, compliance-ready
- Cons: Higher user friction, more support tickets
- Research Support: [PROJECT]-A-COMP-001 (competitors use strict requirements)

**My Lean:** Option A for MVP, with Option B as Phase 2 enhancement

**Your Input Needed:** What's the target user segment? Enterprise or consumer?
