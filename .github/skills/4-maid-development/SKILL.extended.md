# Development Phase Skill

## Phase Overview

**Purpose**: Implement the technical solution according to the spec, with quality built in from the start through TDD practices.

**Entry Criteria**:
- Tech spec phase completed and approved
- Architecture and APIs defined
- Data models specified
- Development environment ready

**Exit Criteria**:
- All features implemented
- All tests passing
- Code reviewed
- Ready for QA validation

## Deliverables

### 1. Production Code
- **Description**: Implementation of all requirements
- **Format**: Clean, documented code following team standards
- **Quality bar**: Passes all tests, follows coding standards, reviewed

### 2. Test Suite
- **Description**: Comprehensive tests at all levels
- **Format**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests as appropriate
- **Quality bar**: >80% coverage, realistic test data, minimal mocking

### 3. Documentation
- **Description**: Code documentation, API docs, README updates
- **Format**: Inline comments, generated docs, markdown
- **Quality bar**: New developer can understand the code

## Role-Specific Guidance

### For Product Managers
- Available for requirement clarifications
- Validate implementation matches intent
- Review user-facing aspects
- Make scope decisions when needed

### For Developers
- Write tests FIRST (TDD)
- Implement to make tests pass
- Keep implementation general (no test-specific code)
- Request clarification rather than assuming

### For QA Engineers
- Review test coverage
- Validate test data quality
- Identify missing test scenarios
- Prepare for QA phase

### For Tech Leads
- Conduct code reviews
- Ensure standards compliance
- Unblock technical issues
- Validate architectural alignment

| Phase | Action | Rule |
|-------|--------|------|
| **RED** | Write failing test | Test MUST fail first |
| **GREEN** | Write minimal code to pass | No extra features |
| **REFACTOR** | Clean up code | Tests still pass |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Skipping TDD | Tests written after code | Write tests first, then implement |
| Test-specific code | `if is_test:` in production | No test-specific logic in prod code |
| Hardcoded values | Matching test expectations exactly | Use proper algorithms, not shortcuts |
| Over-mocking | Everything is mocked | Use real integrations (<20% mocking) |
| Happy path only | Only success cases tested | Test errors and edge cases |
| Weak assertions | `expect(result).toBeDefined()` | Assert exact values |

## Phase Gate Checklist

Before requesting approval to proceed:

- [ ] All features implemented per spec
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Tests use realistic data
- [ ] Edge cases and errors tested
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No test-specific logic in production code
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No skipped tests without justification

## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context
```
1. Read Tech Spec for current task
2. Review API contracts and data models
3. Understand acceptance criteria
```

### Step 2: Write Failing Test
```typescript
// Start with test that describes behavior
test('creates user with valid data', async () => {
  const userData = {
    email: 'test@example.com',
    name: 'Test User'
  };

  const user = await userService.create(userData);

  expect(user.id).toMatch(/^usr_/);
  expect(user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
  expect(user.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
});
```

### Step 3: Implement to Pass
```typescript
// Write minimal code to make test pass
async create(data: CreateUserInput): Promise<User> {
  const user = await this.repository.create({
    id: generateId('usr'),
    ...data,
    createdAt: new Date()
  });
  return user;
}
```

### Step 4: Refactor
```typescript
// Clean up while keeping tests green
async create(data: CreateUserInput): Promise<User> {
  this.validateEmail(data.email);
  return this.repository.create(this.buildUser(data));
}
```

### Step 5: Repeat
Continue with next test case (error handling, edge cases, etc.)

## Transition to QA & Ship Phase

Hand off:
- Complete, tested code
- Test results and coverage report
- Known issues list (if any)
- Deployment instructions
- Any configuration requirements

## Code Quality Standards

### Required
- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] DRY: No copy-pasted logic
- [ ] Type hints on public functions
- [ ] Meaningful variable/function names
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] No hardcoded configuration values

### Forbidden
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] No `// TODO` or `// FIXME` comments
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No test-specific branching
- [ ] No silent exception swallowing

## MANDATORY: Code Documentation Standards

**EVERY file written by MAID MUST include documentation at THREE levels:**

See full reference: `references/documentation-standards.md`

### 1. File-Level Comment (TOP OF FILE)
```typescript
/**
 * @file UserService.ts
 * @description What this file does and its purpose.
 *
 * @related
 *   - ./UserRepository.ts - Data access layer
 *   - ./UserController.ts - HTTP endpoints
 *
 * @created 2025-12-15 by MAID
 */
```

### 2. Component/Class Comment
```typescript
/**
 * UserService - Business logic for user operations.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - User creation and validation
 * - Authentication and session management
 */
export class UserService {
```

### 3. Function Comment (with @related for cross-file references)
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new user account.
 *
 * @param data - User creation data
 * @returns The created user object
 * @throws {ValidationError} If email invalid
 *
 * @related
 *   - ../validators/emailValidator.ts - Email validation
 *   - ./UserRepository.ts - Database persistence
 */
async createUser(data: CreateUserInput): Promise<User> {
```

### Documentation Checklist
- [ ] File has @file, @description, @related, @created at top
- [ ] Every class/component has purpose comment
- [ ] Every function has @param, @returns, @throws, @related
- [ ] Cross-file dependencies documented with @related
- [ ] Non-obvious logic has inline comments

## Learning Mode Integration

### Decision Transparency Triggers
- **Pattern selection**: Show reasoning when choosing design patterns
- **Library choices**: Explain why specific libraries selected
- **Optimization decisions**: Document trade-offs in performance choices
- **Error handling strategy**: Explain approach to error management

### Debate Invitations
- **Implementation approach**: When multiple valid patterns exist
- **Test strategy**: When coverage trade-offs are significant
- **Refactoring scope**: When "good enough" vs "ideal" is unclear

### Feedback Requests
- After significant feature completion: Validate approach
- After code review findings: Confirm understanding of feedback
- At phase gate: Overall code quality rating (1-5)

### Example Transparency Block
```markdown
<decision-transparency>
**Decision:** Using Repository pattern for data access

**Reasoning:**
- **Testability**: Allows mocking data layer in unit tests
- **Abstraction**: Hides database specifics from business logic
- **Consistency**: Matches existing codebase patterns

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Direct ORM calls - Rejected: Harder to test, couples business logic to DB
2. Active Record - Rejected: Less explicit, harder to mock

**Confidence:** High - Standard pattern for this type of application

**Open to Debate:** No - This aligns with team standards
</decision-transparency>
```

### Learning Capture Example
```markdown
<learning-captured>
**What I Learned:**
This team prefers inline comments for complex algorithms over separate docs.

**Source:**
- User feedback on: Code review suggestions
- Context: Was told to add inline explanation instead of README section

**Applied To:**
- Future complex logic will include inline explanations
- Will still use docs for API contracts and architecture

**Verification:**
- Will apply this in next algorithm implementation
