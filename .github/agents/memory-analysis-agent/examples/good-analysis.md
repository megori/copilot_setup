## Why This Is Good

### ✅ Evidence-Based Suggestions

Every suggestion includes:
- Pattern ID reference
- Occurrence count
- Rating/revision metrics
- Supporting quotes (anonymized)

### ✅ Appropriate Confidence Scores

- 0.87 for 4 occurrences with strong metrics
- 0.82 for 3 occurrences with good metrics
- 0.79 for negative pattern (conservative)

### ✅ Actionable Content

Suggestions are specific and actionable:
- "Ask about data flow early" - clear action
- "Write failing test first" - specific technique
- "Don't skip AC review" - clear anti-pattern

### ✅ Proper Memory Format

```
MAID:PM:DISC:ASK "Who else touches this data?" to find hidden stakeholders
```
- Correct format: MAID:ROLE:PHASE:TYPE
- Under 200 characters
- Actionable insight
- No project-specific content

### ✅ Meaningful Trends

Trends compare to previous period and identify:
- What's improving
- What's declining
- What's stable

### ✅ No Project Leakage

No mention of:
- Project names
- Company names
- Specific features
- Code snippets
